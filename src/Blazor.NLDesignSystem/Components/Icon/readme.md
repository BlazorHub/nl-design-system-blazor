# Implementation status
Blazor implementation of [NL Design System](https://nl-design-system.gitlab.io/nl-design-system/index.html) version 0.1.1. 

[Icon](https://nl-design-system.gitlab.io/nl-design-system/core/icons/index.html)
Status: Fully implemented

Additional Comment: Not really a component but still part of the design system with a list of icons.
  Still it is easier to use than making (simple) html.
